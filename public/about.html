<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there ,This is Ayush.I am at the very begining of Web Development at the moment and so I tried hosting a website through github.
I am currently pursuing my B.Tech degree from VIT VELLORE in Computer Science and aspire to a Software Engineer.
It's my 3rd year in college a total of 5 semesters have been completed.
That's all from now.
I'll keep doing activities and hopefully update things here too.
